# BeatNik

Beatnik is a tool I wrote back in 2008 to convert data from an Electrocardiogram (ECG) file into Comma Separated Value (CSV) format for a friend who was a cardiologist.  It extracts data from the three leads (channels) and an example graph in Excel made from Beatnik's output is shown below.

From the first few bytes of a sample file with a '.raw' extension I was able to determine that the file was a Waveform Database (WFDB) signal file in [Format 16](http://www.physionet.org/physiotools/wag/signal-5.htm#sect3) where the amplitude for each sample is represented by a 16-bit twoâ€™s complement stored least significant byte first. A screenshot of Beatnik's user interface is shown below.

You can obtain some sample ECG data to try with Beatnik from [PhysioBank](http://physionet.org/physiobank/) using the [Physionet ATM](http://physionet.org/cgi-bin/atm/ATM) (see the image below).   The two '.dat' files from the [American Heart Association (AHA) Database Sample Excluded Record](http://www.physionet.org/physiobank/database/ahadb/) are in Format 16.
